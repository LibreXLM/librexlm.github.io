  <h1>üåå What is Stellar?</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Stellar</b> is an open-source, decentralized blockchain network designed 
      to connect the world's financial systems. Its primary focus is on 
      <span class="highlight">fast, low-cost payments and asset issuance</span>. 
      With Stellar, anyone can create, send, and trade digital representations 
      of all forms of money ‚Äì dollars, euros, pesos, or crypto assets.
    </p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike many other blockchains that rely on energy-intensive mining, 
      Stellar uses a <span class="highlight">consensus mechanism</span> called the 
      Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). This system allows transactions 
      to be confirmed in a few seconds with very low fees (fractions of a cent).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stellar network is often described as a kind of global 
      <b>decentralized exchange</b>. Users can issue tokens, create 
      <a href="LP.html">Liquidity Pools</a>, or trade directly on the built-in orderbook.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Stellar‚Äôs goal is to make money more <span class="highlight">accessible, efficient, 
      and inclusive</span>. Billions of people worldwide are unbanked or underbanked. 
      Stellar wants to provide these communities with tools to access digital 
      finance without needing traditional banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The non-profit <b>Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)</b> supports this mission. 
      Their focus is on growing the ecosystem, supporting developers, 
      ensuring the stability of the network, and forming partnerships 
      with organizations ranging from NGOs to global payment providers.
    </p>

    <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In a world where financial systems are fragmented and often inefficient, 
      Stellar offers a path toward <b>global interoperability</b>. 
      It envisions a future where sending money is as seamless and cheap 
      as sending an email, and where new kinds of assets (like your own personal token) 
      can thrive alongside traditional currencies.
